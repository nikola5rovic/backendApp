# backendApp
This is mini PHP&amp;MySQL backend app for managing products and admins. I've used OOP, PDO connection, RegEx, little bit of JavaScript and of course HTML5 and CSS3. Also used the 'Josefin Sans' for Google Fonts and Font Awesome CDN for a few icons. 

Exporeted sql database is in the sql folder of the project and the credentials for loginig as an admin are: nikola.eon@gmail.com / 5Rovicnikola!

*I just came across a little issue when running the app on the Xampp server. It seems that authentication for email and password, while trying to edit or add a new admin, doesn't work!

On the other hand when app is started on the Wamp server everyting is ok...
*Bug Uppdate: Application works also on the Ampps server!
