# backendApp
This is mini PHP&amp;MySQL backend app for managing products and admins. I've used OOP, PDO connection, RegEx, little bit of JavaScript and of course HTML5 and CSS3. Also,  A 'Josefin Sans' for Google fonts and Font Awesome CDN for some icons. In the README file you'll find credentials for login as an Admin and where to find the db.
