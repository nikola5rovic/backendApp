# backendApp
This is mini PHP&amp;MySQL backend app for managing products and admins. I've used OOP, PDO connection, RegEx, little bit of JavaScript and of course HTML5 and CSS3. Also used the 'Josefin Sans' for Google Fonts and Font Awesome CDN for fiew icons. 

Exporeted sql database is in the db folder of the project and the credentials for loginig as an admin are: nikola.eon@gmail.com / 5Rovicnikola!
